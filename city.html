        <h2>About Paris</h2>
        <p>
          Paris, the capital of France, is renowned for its art, fashion, gastronomy, and culture.
          The city’s 19th-century cityscape is crisscrossed by wide boulevards and the River Seine.
          It’s also known as the “City of Light” because it was one of the first European cities to adopt gas street lighting.
